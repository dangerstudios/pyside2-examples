# PySide2 examples & templates

This repo contains a series of very basic examples that show how to implement simple widgets in PySide2.

I'm trying to gather some more complex examples that show how to deal with Views and Models as well.

I come here from time to time just to copy paste some boilerplate code before starting a new GUI, especially if it has been a while. üòÅ

They were testing using **Python 2.7** and **PySide2**, mostly because they're aimed at Show TDs, Pipeline TDs, RND guys etc.. and currently Nuke 11 and Houdini 18 ship with PySide2, but not (yet) with Python3.
Ah, yes, Maya 2018+ ships with PySide2 as well, but Maya.. who still writes tools for Maya? üòõ

You can probably port them to use [Qt.py](https://github.com/mottosso/Qt.py) in order to target PyQt4 & PyQt5 PySide & PySide2.
